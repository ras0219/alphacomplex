Alpha Complex
=============

### Compilation

Compile in a separate directory.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

### Execution

Currently, cities are read from stdin or from a file.

    $ ./alphacomplex < ../cities/city02.txt
    $ ./alphacomplex ../cities/city02.txt

### Inspiration

Alpha complex is inspired by the roleplaying game "Paranoia" by Mongoose Publishing.
